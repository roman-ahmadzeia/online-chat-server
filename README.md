# Assignment 02 - Web Chat Server

## A fully functional Web Chat Server Project written showing how to create a web chat server with multiple rooms.This will allow private communication between you and your pals.

### Overview
* We coded our own web chat server using Java web application. 
* The chat server that we created, uses websockets and HTML/Javascript/CSS. 
* Our web chat server has multiple chat rooms, allowing messages to be sent throught the same room.
* When joining a different room, the user will automatically leave the other server room they were in. 
* Lastly the user needs to be in a room for them to be able to send messages.
